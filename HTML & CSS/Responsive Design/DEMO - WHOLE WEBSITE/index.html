                <h1>Epstein Drive</h1>
                <p>The Epstein Drive is a modified Fusion Drive invented by Solomon Epstein Books â€¢ TV around 130 years
                    ago,
                    in approximately 2213 AD BXT. It enabled humanity to travel beyond Earth and the inner planets and
                    colonize the asteroid belt and the outer planets.</p>
                <p>The drive utilizes magnetic coil exhaust acceleration to increase drive efficiency, which enables
                    spaceships to sustain thrust throughout the entire voyage. A ship fitted with the efficient Epstein
                    drive is able to run the drive continuously for acceleration to its goal and then after flipping at
                    about the halfway point is able to run the drive continuously during deceleration. Previous engine
                    designs used propellant less efficiently and could not be run long enough to achieve the high
                    velocities
                    that the Epstein drive permitted.</p>
                <p>Since its invention and up until the discovery of the Ring network, the Epstein drive remained the
                    most
                    advanced transportation technology humanity had access to.</p>

                            is older and less efficient than most current drive models.</li>

                <h1>Warp Drive</h1>
                <p>A warp drive or a drive enabling space warp is a fictional superluminal (faster than the speed of
                    light)
                    spacecraft propulsion system in many science fiction works, most notably Star Trek, and a subject of
                    ongoing physics research. The general concept of "warp drive" was introduced by John W. Campbell in
                    his
                    1957 novel Islands of Space and was popularized by the Star Trek series. Its closest real-life
                    equivalent is the Alcubierre drive, a theoretical solution of the field equations of general
                    relativity.</p>
                <section>
                    <h2>History and Characteristics</h2>
                    <p>Warp drive, or a drive enabling space warp, is one of several ways of travelling through space
                        found
                        in science fiction. It has been often discussed as being conceptually similar to
                        hyperspace. A warp drive is a device that distorts the shape of the space-time
                        continuum. A spacecraft equipped with a warp drive may travel at speeds greater than that
                        of light by many orders of magnitude. In contrast to some other fictitious faster-than-light
                        technologies such as a jump drive, the warp drive does not permit instantaneous travel and
                        transfers
                        between two points, but rather involves a measurable passage of time which is pertinent to the
                        concept. In contrast to hyperspace, spacecraft at warp velocity would continue to interact with
                        objects in "normal space".

                        The general concept of warp drive was introduced by John W. Campbell in his 1957 novel Islands
                        of
                        Space. Brave New Words gave the earliest example of the term "space-warp drive" as
                        Fredric Brown's Gateway to Darkness (1949), and also cited an unnamed story from Cosmic Stories
                        (May
                        1941) as using the word "warp" in the context of space travel, although the usage of this term
                        as a
                        "bend or curvature" in space which facilitates travel can be traced to several works at as far
                        back
                        as the mid-1930s, for example Jack Williamson's The Cometeers (1936).</p>
