                    <h3>Warp drive</h3>
                    <p>A warp drive or a drive enabling space warp is a fictional superluminal (faster than the speed of
                        light) spacecraft propulsion system in many science fiction works, most notably Star Trek, and a
                        subject of ongoing physics research. The general concept of "warp drive" was introduced by
                        John W. Campbell in his 1957 novel Islands of Space and was popularized by the Star Trek series.
                        Its closest real-life equivalent is the Alcubierre drive, a theoretical solution of the field
                        equations of general relativity.</p>
                    <h4>History and characteristics</h4>
                    <p>Warp drive, or a drive enabling space warp, is one of several ways of travelling through space
                        found in science fiction. It has been often discussed as being conceptually similar to
                        hyperspace. A warp drive is a device that distorts the shape of the space-time
                        continuum. A spacecraft equipped with a warp drive may travel at speeds greater than
                        that of light by many orders of magnitude. In contrast to some other fictitious
                        faster-than-light technologies such as a jump drive, the warp drive does not permit
                        instantaneous travel and transfers between two points, but rather involves a measurable passage
                        of time which is pertinent to the concept. In contrast to hyperspace, spacecraft at warp
                        velocity would continue to interact with objects in "normal space".</p>
                    <p>The general concept of warp drive was introduced by John W. Campbell in his 1957 novel Islands of
                        Space. Brave New Words gave the earliest example of the term "space-warp drive"
                        as Fredric Brown's Gateway to Darkness (1949), and also cited an unnamed story from Cosmic
                        Stories (May 1941) as using the word "warp" in the context of space travel, although the usage
                        of this term as a "bend or curvature" in space which facilitates travel can be traced to several
                        works at as far back as the mid-1930s, for example Jack Williamson's The Cometeers
                        (1936).</p>
